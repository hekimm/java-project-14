# Prime Number Checker

A Java console application that checks for prime numbers up to 1000. The program uses a basic function to determine if a number is prime and then prints out all prime numbers from 0 to 1000. This might be useful for those new to Java, looking to understand loops and functions.

## Project Description

This program is designed to introduce beginners to the concept of prime numbers and how to check for them using a simple algorithm in Java. The application iterates through numbers from 0 to 1000, using a helper function `asalMi` to determine if each number is prime. If a number is prime, it is printed to the console.

## Features

- Check each number from 0 to 1000 to see if it is prime.
- Use of a helper function to streamline the process of checking for prime status.
- Print all prime numbers found within the specified range.

## How to Run

To run this application, ensure that you have Java installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Download the `JavaApplication38.java` file.
2. Open a command line interface (CLI).
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Compile the Java file using the command: `javac JavaApplication38.java`.
5. Run the compiled program with the command: `java JavaApplication38`.
